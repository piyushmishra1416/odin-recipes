   <h3>Description:</h3>
   <p>This lovely sauce is brightened by the addition of lemon zest and juice. It's perfect for pasta, but try it over steamed broccoli, or asparagus, for a delightful boost to your side vegetable. This recipe will accompany about a pound of pasta, or 6 to 8 servings of vegetables.</p>
   <ul>Ingredients
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 medium lemon, zested and juiced</li>
      <li>⅓ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
      <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps:</h3>
   <ol>
      <li> Melt butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Once butter is foamy, add garlic, pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li><br>
      <li>
         Gradually whisk in cream, stirring constantly, to incorporate cream into butter. Drizzle in lemon juice, then add lemon zest, while stirring constantly. Keep stirring until sauce coats the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes.</li><br>
         <li> Remove from heat and stir in grated Pecorino Romano and Parmesan cheeses. Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Serve garnished with parsley.
